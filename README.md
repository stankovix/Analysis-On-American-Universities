# **ANALYSIS OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES**

**The aim of this project is to find out which are the most important features that students consider before choosing their preferred American University. Some of the essential questions for developing this project are related to the number of applications, admissions, and enrollments, cost of tuition and fees, cost of living on campus, types of degrees offered, and features of the states where universities are located (population and GDP).**

**The dataset used for this analysis was taken from Kaggle. It contains a lot of information about American Universities (that are not necessarily the top 10-20) in 2013. Although this dataset does not contain information about all the first-ranked American Universities, the patterns and insights extracted from it are highly representative of the whole behavior. The dataset contains more than a thousand rows (Universities) and 145 columns (features about those Universities). Several of those features are out of the scope of this project. Only the features that have information to answer the questions to achieve the goal of the project were deployed. The most powerful tools for data analysis used in this project are the packages Numpy and Pandas, and to visualize and explore the data: Matplotlib and Seaborn was used**

## **STEPS TAKEN IN THIS PROJECT:**

1. Reading the Dataset.
This chapter presents the steps to read the dataset about American Universities.

2. Data Preparation: Cleaning and Formatting.
In all data-analysis projects, the data preparation step is not only necessary but also vital to find and handle features that could cause some problems while making the quantitative analysis, or that could lead to low efficient coding. According to Alivia Smith[1], this step usually takes up to 80% of the entire time of a data analysis project. Therefore, missing, invalid, and inconsistent values have been addressed. Finally, this step presents a code for changing the format of column names.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization. Quantitative and qualitative analysis (Asking and Answering Questions).
Although in many cases, the exploratory data analysis and the quantitative and qualitative analysis are separated steps, in this specific project, they have been joined. This step, previous to asking questions that could lead to reaching the project's aim, presents global-useful information about the different columns of the dataset. Some initial examinations were performed as a way of beginning finding patterns, creating hypotheses, and corroborating early assumptions. Later, deeper investigations were depicted as part of reaching the project's goal.

Quantitative and qualitative analysis: Asking and Answering Questions.
The hypotheses and questions generated to develop this projects are:

Do universities with a high number of applications are the preferred ones by students?; in other words, could the number of applications tell us that a university is one of the most preferred by students?.
Do students prefer universities that have a high rate of admission?, in other words, do students prefer a university where it is easier for them to be admitted?.
Do students prefere public or private universities?
Do students prefer universities with low tuition and fees?
Do students prefer a university for its low on-campus cost of living?
Do students prefer universities from highly populated states?
Do students prefer a university because it belongs to a state with a high GDP per capita?
Do students prefer a university based on the possibility of a higher, additional academic degree in the same university?
4. Inferences and Conclusions.
Although all conclusions and answers are exposed in the previous section accordingly to each question, this section also presents, in a concise manner, the most significant insights.
